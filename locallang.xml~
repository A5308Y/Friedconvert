  <label index="label_lesson_3_item1">Personal names</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item2">People have one or more first names and a family name. Everyone is asked for these when a form must be filled out. In addition other personal details are often required, for example the address, the profession, the marital status (single = ledig, married = verheiratet, divorced = geschieden), and whether one has children and how many one has.   Names have a long tradition. In principle every word can become a family name, therefore also keiner  Keiner and niemand  Niemand.</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item3">Personal details</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item4">An example:</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item5">Conjugation of regular verbs</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item6">Regular verbs/regelm&#228;&#223;ige Verben:</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item7">Please note:   If the root of the verb ends in -t, -e- is added. If the root of the verb ends in -s, s is omitted..   Haben and werden can also be used as normal, independent verbs. Both verbs are not completely regular. Haben gives the sentence a present meaning, werden gives the sentence a future meaning.</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item8">There are many irregular verbs/unregelm&#228;&#223;ige Verben, for example:</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item9">The polite form Sie</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item10">The polite form <i>du</i> is the normal form of address among teenagers and in some areas of work. Otherwise Sie is the form of address to use, unless two people agree to say du to each other.   The singular and plural are the same and the verbs always end in -en in the present tense:</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item11">The finite verb in interrogative sentences and in answering clauses</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item12">Please pay attention to the position of the finite, conjugated verb in interrogative sentences and answering clauses.     The rule is: the finite verb stands in the 2nd position in the sentence. This is true for questions (Fragen) with interrogatives and for answers (Antworten), when the answers are simple answering clauses.     For questions without an interrogative the finite verb stands at the beginning of the sentence. Questions without an interrogative are decision questions. In principle one can only answer with Ja or Nein.   Other positions of the finite verb will be dealt with later.</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item13">The modal verbs m&#246;chten and m&#252;ssen</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item14">The modal verbs are conjugated and linked with non-finite, but not with conjugated verbs.</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item15">expresses a wish. It is a regular verb.</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item16">means that something is urgently required. It is a regular verb, but has an umlaut (&#252;) in the plural.</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item17">Detailed information in the sentence</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item18">You will certainly have already realised that some sentences require some necessary detailed information to be complete:</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item19">In lesson 1 there are also some sentences with additional details:</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item20">Adjectives, simple words, or groups of words can also be forms of information, for example:</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item21">The position in the sentence is generally after the finite verb, but this can also vary.   subject  finite verb detail  complement</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item22">Are the verbs haben and werden    regular,  not completely regular,     irregular?</label>
  <label index="label_lesson_3_item23">Which position does the finite Verb have in questions with interrogatives?    1st   Position  or 2nd  Position?</label>
